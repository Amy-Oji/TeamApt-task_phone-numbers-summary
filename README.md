### Phone Numbers Summary Generator App
*****
This is a java application that generates a summary report of the total number of phone numbers for each service provider(MTN, Airtel, Globacom, 9Mobile & MTEL). The application was developed with Java17.

Correctness and speed was considered a priority in developing the app.

Data(1 million phone numbers) was collected from a txt file attached to the resources folder of the program.

The application reads the file, then groups the phone numbers according to the following prefixes-

**MTN:** 0703,0706,0803,0806,0810,0813,0814,0816,0903,0906,0913,0916,07025,07026,0704

**Airtel:** 0701,0708,0802,0808,0812,0901,0902,0904,0907,0912

**Globacom:** 0705,0805,0807,0811,0815,0905,0915

**9Mobile:** 0809,0817,0818,0909,0908

**MTEL:** 0804

The app then prints a summary of phone numbers of each of the service providers to the console.
